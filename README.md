# The-Data-Syndicate
This project aims to proactively leverage data to improve students' performance in final exams like JAMB and WASSCE. Our goal is to ensure that an overwhelming majority of students score above average. We conducted surveys in two secondary schools to collect data on studentsâ€™ study habits, exam performance, and teacher feedback to build a data-driven solution.
